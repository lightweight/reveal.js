						<p>I'm here to talk to you about some ideas I've had for teaching IT to young people and</p>
						<ul>
						  <li>dispel some common misconceptions about IT,</li>
						  <li>attempt lighten the load for some,</li>
						  <li>and, if I'm lucky, make a difference for our industry and our broader society.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>By the way, I use the term "IT" as a synonym for ICT or ICTs or Digital Technology. IT is the term we use in industry.</p>

						<p>I've been a professional software developer and IT consultant for 20 year and ran my own business for 14 of those. I studied physics and engineering and originally worked as a research scientist. I have little formal IT training - I learned just about everything I know "along the way", mostly because I found it interesting and rewarding.</p>

					<blockquote>"Education can be encouraged from the top down, but can only be improved from the ground up"</blockquote>
					<p>- Sir Ken Robinson via Twitter</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Learning IT isn't about being taught. In my experience learning IT starts with a vision, and turns into exploration to work out how realise it. Learners need the opportunity to explore and try things out at their own pace. I think IT understanding rides the coat tails of other passions.</p>
					</aside>

					<h1>The Internet</h1>
					<p>An unparalleled bounty and a new era: Digital Abundance</p>
					<p>Discovery requires only access, time and motivation</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>The Economics of Scarcity were used to describe the industrial era. It is now largely past. The future is governed by the Economics of Digital Abundance [ref]</p>
						<p>Many of the most influential and innovative people in the IT industry are exceedingly young, some still in high school. Common thread: they weren't taught - they foraged on the Internet for their own knowledge. Some are lucky enough to have mentors to support them, but even so, they are self-taught.</p>
					</aside>

				<section>
					<h1>Learning</h1>
					<p>Passion x Opportunity x Time</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Where creative passion is combined with opportunity and <em>time</em>, there's going to be some learning.</p>

						<p>The people who can make a career and real difference in IT are those who are inherently fascinated by technology, and want to know how it works.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Career Advancing IT</h1>
					<p>Reguires passion, attitude, and aptitude.</p>
					<p>IT in-and-of-itself is not for everyone...</p>
					<p>.. but every other career requires IT skills, too.</p>


					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I accept that only a small percentage of people have that natural inquisitiveness, and dogged problem solving drive, that characterises all the great IT practitioners I know. We need to make sure that more of those sorts of people are given the opportunity to find their calling.</p>

						<p>Many of the really sharp developers I hired were <em>right out of school</em> - in some cases highschool, before they'd finished. Probably about half of the really good developers and IT experts I know have formal training, mostly at the university level. In IT it's not uncommon for people who haven't finished highschool to be working on teams with PhDs, on equal footing.</p>

					<h1>IT Everywhere</h1>
					<p>A continuum:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>a field in its own right</li>
						<li>a set of tools to amplify work in <em>any field</em></li>
					</ul>

					<aside class="notes">
						<h1>Elements of IT Education:</h1>
						<ol>
  						<li>IT is a subject/field unto itself, but more importantly</li>
  						<li>It's a tool of empowerment, to be applied to any subject as well as social participation.</li>
						</ol>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Compose and Broadcast</h1>
					<p>IT is like a pen combined with a printing press.</p>
					<p>On steroids.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Never before in human history has there been the opportunity for everyone, anywhere, to create something which can reach a global audience.</p>
						<p>Remember, on the Internet, thanks to IT, there needn't be more than one degree of separation. If someone has something to say, and it strikes the right sort of chord, it can change <em>everything</em>.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>The 3 "R"s + IT</h1>
					<p>Today, IT competence is mandatory.</p>
					<p>IT is the new literacy.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>IT literacy - being able to make a computer work for you - is a key skill for <em>everyone</em> today, and it will only get more important. Without it, you're largely unemployable.</p>

						<p>By the same token, IT experts who can also write and speak - communicate - well, then they are even more so - we need to make sure that the siren song of technology doesn't steal attention from non-technical learning.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section class="left">
					<h1>Embracing IT</h1>
					<p>The "flavour of the month" doesn't matter.</p>
					<p>Focus on underlying principles:</p>
					<ul>
						<li>Online etiquette</li>
						<li>Good Digital Hygene</li>
						<li>Awareness of "Digital Shadow"</li>
						<li>Be sceptical of <em>everything</em></li>
						<li>When in doubt, contribute</li>
					</ul>

					<p>Set sensible expectations.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Teachers faced with covering Digital Technologies, in my experience, find it a big ask. IT is a broad and deep field that flows rapidly. Even those of us who work in it full time find it a big challenge to stay current.</p>

						<p>We can change the expectation on teachers. Rather than needing to be experts in IT or specific software, should complement their teaching talents by becoming experts in the etiquette of the Internet, how to search and learn, how to filter content fostering scepticism, and how to participate in and contribute to online communities by doing so themselves.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section class="left">
					<h1>Culture Shift</h1>
					<ol>
						<li>IT <em>can be</em> part of every subject.</li>
						<li>For a subset of learners, IT will become the focus.</li>
					</ol>
					<p>Both sorts of learners need support, but they'll lead the way.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I'm keen to see two kinds of IT learning:</p>
						<ol>
							<li>that all learners know how to use IT to advance and amplify the learning they want to do (because IT can be applied in all fields - <em>but it doesn't have to be!)</em></li>
							<li>that the subset of learners who are "switched on" by IT itself have the ability to follow that inspiration to the extent that their interest moves them.</li>
						</ol>

						<p>And I'm not suggesting we build a white elephant - I want to build on existing culture, institutions and resources.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Opportunity</h1>
					<p>Within school, but more importantly, without.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Providing the opportunity to learn means providing access to technology outside school as well as within it.  That means: at home, at the library, school out of hours, marae.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Natural Creators</h1>
					<p>What not to teach: how to be a good little consumer.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>They need to be encouraged to be creators rather than consumers. There's little doubt that they have the time. If they also have interest and opportunity, there's little doubt that they will surprise us, often in good ways.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Cross-pollination</h1>
					<p>Disciplines colliding for mutual improvement.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>I believe in the concept of cross pollination - it's freaky how often problems in one field appears to be completely different from problems in another field, but when experts in the two field get together they notice similarities in their problems, and a solution in one field ends up providing the key insights into a solution for the problem in other field.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Unexpected Inspiration</h1>
					<p>An IT analogue to Surf Lifesaving.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>IT analogue to Surf Lifesaving - intensely local community focal point:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>sponsored IT clubhouses</li>
  						<li>lots of fun along with learning/confidence building opportunities</li>
  						<li>opportunity for collaboration and competition among peers
  community focused - becomes social focus for some kids</li>
  						<li>civic opportunities - expect kids to show responsibility</li>
  						<li>intergenerational - includes younger kids, parents, businesses and whole community</li>
						</ul>
						<p>Analgous IT organisation not as far fetched as it might sound.</p>

				<section>
					<h1>Share and Sharing Alike</h1>
					<p>The bounty is growing, for the benefit of teachers <em>and</em> learners.</p>
					<p>Rewards are greatest for those who share.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Lots of efforts are already addressing pieces of the puzzle:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>We could have a coderdojo that meets a couple afternoons or evenings a week at the local library computer lab</li>
							<li>Look for your local makerspaces and crafty creative hang-outs - we have a makercrates</li>
							<li>Perhaps the local primary and secondary school IT facilities are standing idle a lot of the time</li>
							<li>Perhaps there could be facilities at the local marae</li>
							<li>There are facilities at the local library, many underutilised</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Social involvement opportunities:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>supporting local primary schools</li>
							<li>supporting residents at retirement communities</li>
							<li>working at library</li>
							<li>"Open Badges" - earn internationally recognised qualifications at any age! [ref]</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Pull in local industry as sponsors and mentors:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>local and regional competitions</li>
							<li>hackfests</li>
							<li>grants for projects</li>
							<li>internships</li>
							<li>sponsorships to attend technical conferences</li>
						</ul>

						<p>Digital Technology Teachers and IT professionals around the world are creating incredible materials for learning. They're online and freely accessible to anyone. They can be used at school, but also anywhere else.</p>

						<p>Tim Bell from the University of Canterbury will be talking about some of these, and CodeClub NZ is launching here, too.</p>

						<p>Programmes I'd like to see in more schools:</p>
  					<ul>
							<li>CS Unplugged - http://csunplugged.org</li>
  						<li>CS Field Guide - http://www.csfieldguide.org.nz</li>
  						<li>Coder Dojos - https://coderdojo.com</li>
  						<li>Code Club - http://www.codeclub.org.nz</li>
						</ul>

					<h1>What Boundaries?</h1>
					<p>Exploration should be limited only by the learner's interest, not by facilities or teachers' comfort levels.</p>
					<p>No glass ceilings in an open source world.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>On the Internet, the most interesting aspect of IT, there are no limitations on the level to which learners can explore. They're never in the situation of being able to see through a window without being able to touch what's inside.</p>
						<p>To clarify, that level of discoverability or access should not be confused with lack of security. They're not really linked in an open source world.</p>
					</aside>
				</section>

				<section>
					<h1>Boundless Opportunity</h1>
					<p>IT is an open frontier of global proportions. IT defines opportunity.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>IT is still an open frontier, characterised countless little unexplored niches and problems to be solved - usually places where different interests or disciplines intersect. In many of those areas, there is no "expert", yet a good software solution could provide great value for many. That is the definition of opportunity.</p>
						<p>Kids around the world today are already writing software that all of us use every day.</p>

					<h1>Trust your Tour Guides</h1>
					<p>In this brave new world, our guides are the young.</p>
					<p>They lead by sharing their ideas because they haven't yet been taught not to - let's learn from them.</p>

					<aside class="notes">
						<p>Many of you will be familiar with the open source Firefox web browser. Fewer of you will know that it was largely written by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Ross">Blake Ross</a>, a 16 year old in California, incidentally collaborating with a second year student at University of Auckland, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goodger">Ben Goodger</a>.</p>
						<p>In 2004, when Blake was 19, Firefox was released, and was downloaded 100 million times in its first year. It single handledly altered the face of the web, and the innovation stifling monopoly held by Microsoft at the time. Ben works at Google in Silicon Valley these days on the Chrome browser, and Blake is working for Facebook - I understand that at age 27, he's worth $150 million - pretty good for working on free software.</p>
